			<h3>Samantha Kemps</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Samantha Kemps, I'm 20 years old and live in London, Ontario. I haven't always live in London, I have lived in
				over eight different towns. I originally was in school for Interior Decorating at Georgian College but didn't feel it suited
				me, now I am in Interactive Media Design. I am Vegan, I am obessed animals and I enjoy playing hockey.
				<br>I love the family I have started with my boyfriend of five and half years, Justin, we have two
				 dogs, a cat and a hedgehog all named after StarWars characters! We met at a wedding in October 2012 started talking to
				 find out we were on the same hockey team! After years of playing hockey and going to the same highschool we finally moved
				 in together 3hours away from our hometown when we were only 18. Now we are 20 taking our second shot at college, living
				 in a beautiful apartment, working our butts off.
				 <br>Thats a little about me and my life, Thanks for reading.
